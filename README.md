# Rock Paper Scissors

Rock Paper Scissors is an online game made to draw users in using eye catching colors and lets the players try their luck
against a computer who chooses its options randomly. First to get 5 points wins the match! Compete against friends or family members to see who can beat the computer! Do you feel lucky?

-__The Game options__

- The game clearly states that first to 5 wins the match and urges the player to choose one of the images.

- The ROCK PAPER SCISSORS buttons have hover effects so as soon as the player hovers over one of them it reacts and temps the player to press on it.

- The score is updated by 1 point depending on who wins the round.

### Features Left to Implement

- A future idea to implement would be Spock and Lizard. The images are already added and a function could be made so that after reaching 5 points the SPOCK button gets added, then when the player reaches 10 points the LIZARD button also gets added and the game continues to 20 points before resetting again.

## Testing 

- I have tested the site on Chrome, Safari and Firefox, both on my laptop and on my Iphone 12 Pro Max. Firefox on my laptop needed some extra work because it didnt support the

"backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(12px);"

codes directly, I googled the issue and in a later update they will be adding this function to their browser, for now all it took was to enable it in the settings. It works fine on mobile devices without having to do anything.

- Also, the website looks good and all functions work on Ipad Pro, Iphone 12 pro Max, Iphone X and MacBook Pro 15Â´.

- Using the Devstools I can confirm this website is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes.

- The Sign Up form works properly, requieres entries in evry field and the Sign me Up button changes color when hovered.
