# Rock Paper Scissors

Rock Paper Scissors is an online game made to draw users in using eye-catching colors and lets the players try their luck
against a computer that chooses its options randomly. The first to get 5 points wins the match! Compete against friends or family members to see who can beat the computer! Do you feel lucky?

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __The Game options__

    - The game clearly states that the first to 5 wins the match and urges the player to choose one of the images.

    - The ROCK PAPER SCISSORS buttons have hover effects so as soon as the player hovers over one of them it reacts and temps the player to press on it.

### Features Left to Implement

- A future idea to implement would be Spock and Lizard. The images are already added and a function could be made so that after reaching 5 points the SPOCK button gets added, then when the player reaches 10 points the LIZARD button also gets added and the game continues to 20 points before resetting again.

## Testing 

- I have tested the site on Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, both on my laptop and my iPhone 12 Pro Max. The game works as it should on all of them, the score updates as it should, game shows winner or tie of each round as its supposed to do, and game resets when a player or the computer reaches 5 points.

- Also, the game looks good and all functions work on Ipad Pro, iPhone 12 pro-Max, iPhone X, and MacBook Pro 15??.

- Using the Devstools I can confirm this website is responsive, looks good, and functions on all standard screen sizes.

###  Bugs
- One bug that kept bothering me was when I pressed a button and the results was shown, it was possible to press on the buttons still and the game would register it. Solved it by using the following code
    - if (gameArea.classList.contains("results-shown")){ 
        return;

- Not a bug but I did forget to properly git push alot in the begining which resulted in nothing was saved. Lesson learned.

As far as I know, there are no unfixed bugs. 

## Deployment
